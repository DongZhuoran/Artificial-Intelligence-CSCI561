Assignments for CSCI561 at USC

## HW1
### HW1a
Implemented a simple reflex agent.
### HW1b
Implemented an algorithm to solve a variant N-Queen problem: the grid size may be greater than the number of queens and there are points on each crossing, you should maximize the whole points you get.
* DFS
* DFS + Bit manipulation
* DFS + Pruning

## HW2
Developed a two-player game-playing agent using DFS with memorization in a non-zero sum problem to predict the best next move.

## HW3
Inplemented an algorithm to calculate the best next action for each state to get most rewards finally given the initial rewards of each state and transition model.
* Markov decision process
